# üß† Text and Voice to Indian Sign Language Converter

A Flask-based application that converts text and voice input to Indian Sign Language (ISL) using SIGML animations and the Stanford Parser.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è UPDATE

**Stanford Parser is no longer accessible directly via URL.**  
Please follow these steps:

1. **Download** the [Stanford Parser ZIP manually](https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/lex-parser.html).
2. **Extract** it into the same directory where your `main.py` is located.
3. **Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable** to your JDK installation path.
4. **Add `%JAVA_HOME%\bin` to your system PATH.**

Refer to external guides on setting `JAVA_HOME` if you're unsure how to do this.

## üìù Note

- This project uses **SIGML** files to animate ISL signs.
- These files are manually created and **may not be 100% accurate**, as generating SIGML using **HamNoSys** is a complex and time-consuming process.

We welcome improvements or corrections to SIGML animations from the community.
